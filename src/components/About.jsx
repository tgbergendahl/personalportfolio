        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>I am a passionate researcher and a skilled developer with a strong background in mathematics, 
            machine learning, and classical computer science concepts. I have tackled projects in natural
             language processing, deep learning, reinforcement learning, and computational genetics, 
             which has turned me into a well-rounded scientist. I believe in strong communication skills
             and collaboration, for which I have made an effort to become a strong writer, presenter, and teammate.
             I am looking for opportunities to contribute and grow my skills in machine learning, data science,
             software development, and computational genetics. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you'd
             like to connect!</p>
